\section{Upload your enhancements}

If you'd like to enhance the default chess program, which by default plays a fairly simple game, please click the "Download greedy.metta" 
button below.
Then open the program and modify it in your favorite editor. 

After making changes, click the "Upload Chess Program" button. Your updated game will run when the main tutorial "Play Chess"
button above is clicked. To revert to the default program again, click "Reset Atomspace" and then click
"Play Chess".
