\subsection{Playing the Chess Game}

If at any time you want to play the default MeTTa chess game, please click the "Reset Atomspace"
button above if enabled and then click "Play Chess". 

If "Reset Atomspace" is greyed-out, atomspace is empty, so you can simply click "Play Chess" and the default program will load into atomspace. 

The default research chess game plays in a "greedy" fashion. It doesn't plan far ahead yet -- primarily taking the best present move. At this writing, castling, pawn promotion and pawn en passant moves are not yet enabled. The greedy program plays a slightly simplified variation of chess.

Although in this tutorial a backend MeTTa server is used, you get your own private atomspace stored
in your browser. The atomspace you see if you click "Display Atomspace" is exactly what MeTTa uses (reformatted for readability).
